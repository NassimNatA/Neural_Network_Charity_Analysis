# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to utilize machine learning to evaluate features in the neural network dataset to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by the company Alphabet Soup and to make informed decisions about potential investments. 

## Results: 
### Data Preprocessing
- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?

The variable considered the target for this model is IS_SUCCESSFUL column.

- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?

The variables considered to be features for this model are: APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, 
STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, ASK_AMT

- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

The variables that should be removed from the input data are EIN, NAME since they are not targets or features. 


### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
For my neural network model, I selected 2 layers and 100 nodes for the first layer and 80 nodes for the second layer.

- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
